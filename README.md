Gameplay
The nature of the gameplay is a fishing simulator game. The player can cast their line and must wait for a nibble. The first challenge of the game is to successfully catch fish. To catch a fish, the player must click following a nibble (notified with image and sound). Next, they must click within a green box that is moving up and down for a certain period of time (i.e. 4 seconds). There will be a bank of possible fish to be caught, with differing rarity of each. The player can sell fish to the market; price is dependent on the rarity of the fish. The player can purchase upgrades, such as better fishing rods or bait, which can decrease likelihood of catching junk or decrease time to get a nibble. 
Victory
Since the player will be catching fish and selling them to the market for money, they will be saving up their money to buy the most expensive and coveted upgrade of them all –– the ultimate rod. The ultimate rod is the only fishing rod that can be used to catch a rare whale shark, which no one has ever succeeded in catching before. Once the player catches the whale shark with the ultimate rod, they win. 
Interaction Model 
We will be using both mouse and keyboard inputs for our game. The player will click their mouse once a fish nibbles on the hook, and during the minigame must click within the green box. To go to the market, the player will hit the M button on the keyboard and to quit the game they will hit the esc key. 
Game Structure
Our game will have three main states: the prologue, in which the player talks to the market owner to discover the narrative of the story; the market menu, where the player can sell their fish for money and purchase upgrades for their rod; and the dock, where the player will go to catch a random fish via the fishing minigame. 




Narrative
While this game isn’t heavily focused on the narrative, there is a small narrative that will be introduced to the player at the beginning of the game in the form of a conversation. The market which you sell fish and buy upgrades from is owned by One-Armed Joe. He is an old fisherman who lost his arm to the legendary whale shark! He needs you to avenge his arm by catching the beast.

Audience
This game is meant to be a cozy fishing simulator game. We target an audience who wants to have a relaxing, therapeutic experience while playing our game. With that being said, our game still has a draw to continue playing: catching different types of fish that spawn randomly, getting fishing upgrades to increase the chances of catching rare fish, and to achieve victory by catching the legendary whale shark beast.
